/**
 * 
 * So in main we've got some example code that runs a
 * calculation.  But we want to run 2 calculations at 
 * the same time.  Use threads to make it possible to
 * do this.  I recommend you create an inner
 * class that implements runnable in this class.  This
 * inner class should take the name of the job
 * as a parameter to it's constructor.
 * 
 * If you do this right you should see something like:
 *
 * Starting Job 1
 * Starting Job 2
 * Finishing Job 1
 * Finishing Job 2
 * 
 * although the order that the jobs finish isn't fixed - 
 * job 2 could finish first.
 * 
 * When you finish, go on to the next file for part 2.
