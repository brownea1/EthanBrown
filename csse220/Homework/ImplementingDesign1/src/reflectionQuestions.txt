Reflection Questions:

1.A In your implementation could you replace each Question class with just a Java String (yes or no)? 
	No

1.B Explain why or why not? (2-3 sentences)
	Because the Question class does not just have a String field and nothing else.
	The question class also has to store an ID, which a Java String cannot normally do.


2.A. What data type did you use to represent the 1-to-many relationship between QuizMain and Question? (provide the type declaration)
	ArrayList<Question> questionList;	


2.B. What is another data type could you have used? (provide the type declaration) 
	HashMap<Integer, Question> questionMap;


2.C. Would that have made your implementation easier or harder to implement? Explain why? (2-3 sentences)
	Looking back, I think using a HashMap would have made my implementation easier.
	This is because I would have been able to use the Id as the key, and would not have
	had to make a search algorithm for finding the Question that is associated with the Id.
	This also would have ensured that there were no duplicate Ids.
