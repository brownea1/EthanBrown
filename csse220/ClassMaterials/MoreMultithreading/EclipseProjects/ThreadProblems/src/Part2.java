/**
 * Let's imagine a more complication situation 
 * where once again, like part 1, we have multiple calculations
 * that should run in parallel. However, 
 * now a calculation the requires 4 steps.
 * Step 1 must be finished before steps 2A & 2B start.
 * Step 2A & 2B can be run in parallel. Step 3 can only start 
 * after both Steps 2A & 2B finish.
 *
 * Solution? 
 * Threads that while running, thread other threads to do 
 * part of the work!
 * 
 * You'll probably want to reuse your inner class
 * from Part 1, but you'll also need a new inner
 * class for this one.
 * 
 * If you do this correctly, running a single job
 * should look like this:
 * 
 * Starting Buffalo job Step 1
 * Finishing Buffalo job Step 1
 * Starting Buffalo job Step 2A
 * Starting Buffalo job Step 2B
 * Finishing Buffalo job Step 2A
 * Finishing Buffalo job Step 2B
 * Starting Buffalo job Step 3
 * Starting Buffalo job Step 3
 * 
 * Running 2 jobs should look something like this:
 * 
 * Starting Job 2 Part 1
 * Starting Job 1 Part 1
 * Finishing Job 2 Part 1
 * Finishing Job 1 Part 1
 * Starting Job 2 Part 2A
 * Starting Job 2 Part 2B
 * Starting Job 1 Part 2A
 * Starting Job 1 Part 2B
 * Finishing Job 1 Part 2B
 * Finishing Job 2 Part 2A
 * Finishing Job 1 Part 2A
 * Finishing Job 2 Part 2B
 * Starting Job 1 Part 3
 * Starting Job 2 Part 3
 * Finishing Job 2 Part 3
 * Finishing Job 1 Part 3
