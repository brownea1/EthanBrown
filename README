This repository is for showing employeers the code that I, Ethan Brown, have worked on. Currently, I am a Freshman computer science student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
In this document, you will find descriptions for the folders in my repository, detailing what type of projects those folders contain.

CSSE 220 - 
  This is the folder for Introduction to Object-Oriented Software Development, which is a class I am currently taking. This class focuses on introducing Java, and many of it's
  concepts. Most of the focus is on common object-oriented data structures, and the proper use of objects in code. This class has an emphasis on general software development
  design principles, and teaches students how to plan out their ideas using UML diagrams and how to understand what code is needed based on a description of the program. Most
  files in this folder are projects and assignments focused on manipulating data structures such as ArrayList and HashMap, or utilizing object-oriented design principles.
  In this folder, you will see my principled coding format, and my ability to problem solve.
